Abstract
Understanding similarity is a central question in the field of cognitive science. Similarity is used in industry to tackle topics such as semantic seg- mentation, recommendation systems, scene un- derstanding, and even text mining. Deep neu- ral networks have been the popular choice in solving these perception problems and have even reach or surpassed human-level accuracy. In this paper, we examine and extend on the method- ologies implemented in Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations (J. Peterson and T.Griffiths, 2016). In addition to developing three neural networks, we collect similarity ratings data from 57 human subjects. We examine the connection between representa- tions learned by the networks and human judge- ments, and also manipulate the deep features to align more with human judgements. We further analyze human judgements by comparing sim- ilarity judgements based on survey participant behavior such as time to complete and rating by stimuli sequence. By understanding how image representations differ for the same person, we can apply this extended human behavior knowledge to areas such as image recommendation plat- forms.
