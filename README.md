Proposal - Computational Cognitive Modeling, Spring 2021

For our computational cognitive modeling project, we plan to replicate and extend Peterson et. al.’s “Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations.” We will revisit the data and python code from Homework 1 Part D. In Peterson et. al., authors looked at 120 color photographs of animals. We plan to find a dataset of animal images (i.e. birds) from ImageNet, and we’ll investigate what pairs of images are more similar based on similarity ratings from people and a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition. So far, we’ve found a 2,000 bird-species dataset with 11,788 bird images on Kaggle, and plan to start with that dataset. 

Finally, we hope to gather human subjects data from our peers to have a comparison between human and machine category similarity ratings. Since our human feedback comes from our peers instead of Amazon Mechanical turk, the scale of human feedback will be smaller than the paper’s. In the paper, Peterson had 10 unique participants rating 7,140 image comparisons. We plan to have 10 participants rating 300 image pair comparisons (15 color images). We would like to discuss and compare our pre-trained results to human recognition feedback. 

We plan to do the project in a Jupyter notebook and write up the paper using Overleaf. Initially, we believe this research will be useful for image search engines, and we hope to think of more use cases after a more thorough literature review.
